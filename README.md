## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Architecture

The code architecture is based on the MainWindow class. This class controls the user interface and manages the processes.

The code makes extensive use of Qt functionalities, like QProcess to manage processes, QTimer to update the process list, and various widgets like QTableWidget, QPushButton, and QLineEdit.

The code also utilizes various operating system functionalities, like the `kill` function to kill or send signals to processes, and the `getpriority` and `setpriority` functions to get and set the priority of a process.
